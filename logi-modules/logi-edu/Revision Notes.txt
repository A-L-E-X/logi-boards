Revision Notes

Next version

R1.0
140321
- created more clearance on top side of breadboard area.
140319
-SENT TO OSHPARK
- Adding servo control option.  vcc, gnd, servo strip on the breadboard.
  - sharing 3 pins to have connected by default to the servo signals.
  - sharing pins.  ps/2 pins (not likely used with servo)
  - using 1 a
  udio pwm

  Errata:
  - the pmods are labeled wrong!
140318
- added series resistor to Hsync, Vsync signa.  Saftey.
- adding 3 bits / color on vga.  Pong book only runs 1 ps/2 simultanesly.
So will use the share the second ps/2 port with VGA R,B bits 3.  There was unused
pin that was being run to the breadboard area.  Sharing this with G bit(3)
- added ext header and jumper to select.  See digilent PMOD.  accepts 5V
- increased the SSEG hole size.
- Added series resistors to PS/2
- setting PWM cutoff for audio.:
http://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-audio-player/sound-playback
    - set cutoff to 1/10th the PWM frequency.  250Khz sounds good, which is what they use.
    So: .1uF and 68ohm
    - papilio uses 3.3k and 4.7nf = 10K cutoff  (based on xilinx app note)
    - http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp154.pdf
- Added 1206 footprints for audio output

RA3:
    CHANGLOG:
    - adding mounting holes to add standoffs from the bottom of the board
    - added 5V header so do not need to use the extended PMOD header

PREVIOUS
- There was something wrong with the PS/2 pins????   Cant remember now.
        - PULLUPS WERE TIED TO GROUND!?!

- Added pullups to ps2 pins
- lowered the vga output resistor values (brighter display)

Test jig connections:
- sseg test all 4 segments - all segment on - all segments off
- ps2_2 = vga grayscale bit 3
  - plug
- ps2_1 = ps/2 jig, short clk/data pins
- audio = short audio pins, or run audio speaker output
- nes2 = nes_clk - nes2_datA
- nes1 = nes1_data - nes_lat
