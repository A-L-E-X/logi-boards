Revision Notes
R1.0
- added ext header and jumper to select.  See digilent PMOD.  accepts 5V
- increased the SSEG hole size.
- Added series resistors to PS/2
- setting PWM cutoff for audio.:

    - set cutoff to 1/10th the PWM frequency.  250Khz sounds good, which is what they use.
    So: .1uF and 68ohm
    - papilio uses 3.3k and 4.7nf = 10K cutoff  (based on xilinx app note)
    - http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp154.pdf
- Added 1206 footprints for audio output


RA3:
    CHANGLOG:
    - adding mounting holes to add standoffs from the bottom of the board
    - added 5V header so do not need to use the extended PMOD header


PREVIOUS
- There was something wrong with the PS/2 pins????   Cant remember now.
        - PULLUPS WERE TIED TO GROUND!?!

- Added pullups to ps2 pins
- lowered the vga output resistor values (brighter display)
