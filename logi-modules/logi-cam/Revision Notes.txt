R1.1
    - see fixed from errata!
R1.0
    - Added thru hole resistor and SMT transistor.
    - added better via stitching

    ERRATA:
    -  OV7670 RESET NEEDS PULLED HIGH TO STAY ACTIVE!!!!! Opposite of what the datasheet says!
    - OV7725 still has issue.  Needs to be pulled low!!!
    - The mosfet had the wrong pinout.  Fixed!!!!

RA.3
    Changes:
    - Added solder jumpers for easy configuration.  The camera can be used with no
    components populated if using the Header cameras.  Just make proper jumper connections



RA.2
    Changes:
    - Added pull up resistors, in case camera does not have them populated(all
    cameras have had them populated to date).
    Errata:
    -
